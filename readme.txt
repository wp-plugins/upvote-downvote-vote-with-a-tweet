= Global Settings =
-----
The main settings page allows you to set global parameters that will affect the display of all banners.

**Include surrounding &lt;div&gt;** 

The banner is placed on the page using this generic html snippet:

> &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href&gt;&lt;img /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Uncheck this box to omit the &lt;div&gt; element from the output, this can also be set on a per-banner basis

**Image width type**

- Percentage : The image width is set to "100%" to fill any container. 

- Fixed width : The width of the image is set to the actual pixel width of the image.

**Div width type**

Select whether or not the div has no width attribute set (default) or has a "width:123px" style that matches the width of the contained image. Useful if you have inherited "floats".

**&lt;div&gt; custom style**

Anything you enter in this box will appear in the style tag of the div. e.g. "padding-bottom:20px;"
If you exclude the div element then this will have no effect.

**&lt;img&gt; custom style**

Anything you enter in this box will appear in the style tag of the image. e.g. "padding-bottom:20px;"
